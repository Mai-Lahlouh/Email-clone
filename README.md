- Folder Management: Emails are categorized into inbox, drafts, sent items, and possibly other folders for organizational purposes.
- Email Details: Users can view detailed information about emails, including sender, subject, and content.
- Trash: Emails can be moved to the trash folder for eventual deletion.
- Responsive UI: The application's frontend is built using React to provide a seamless user experience across devices.
  
### Technologies Used:

- Frontend: React for building the user interface.
- Backend: Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic.

### Conclusion:
The Email Clone application aims to provide a robust email management experience using modern web technologies. It leverages the power of the MERN stack to deliver efficient email sending, storage, and organization capabilities. As it continues to evolve, the application seeks to offer even more features and enhancements to meet user expectations and needs in managing their email communications effectively.
